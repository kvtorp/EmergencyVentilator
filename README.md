Concepts for a 3D printable, absolute-emergency ventilator 

My doctor friend outlined the following requirements for a reasonably useful device:
* Volumen between 300 and 1000 ml of air
* In/exhalation cycle of 5-6 seconds (10-12 cycles per minute)
* Assisted inhalation
* Assisted exhalation
* Pressure at end of inhalation must be less than 20 cm of water (that would be 20 mbar, 2000 Pa)
* Pressure at end of exhalation must be at least 4 cm of water
* The breathing cycle must be 30 % inhalation, 10% pause, 60% exhalation

Right now I am looking at a "book lung" style double-action pump, but I am worried about mechanical stability, which I didn't think into the concept.

For valves, I am thinking about using floppy-diaphragm valves as found in the purge valves of schnorkels, they give reasonable results even with a piece of paper as diaphragm. It should be possible to seal everything with duct tape and Vaseline, as no high pressure is required nor desired.
